## Shared chrome for Godoban's modals — the epics dialog, the board switcher and the message box.
##
## The task editor is the reference look: a dimmed backdrop over the main screen with a centered,
## rounded, bordered panel whose header ends in a ✕. The other dialogs used to be `PopupPanel`s,
## i.e. Godot `Window`s. An *embedded* window paints its own opaque `embedded_border` frame behind
## its panel stylebox, and that frame has square corners — which is what showed as black wedges in
## the rounded corners. Drawing the modal as plain canvas UI instead leaves the panel's own
## stylebox as the only chrome there is, so the corner radius, the border, the ✕ and the centering
## are literally one piece of code for every popup and can't drift apart again.
##
## A subclass fills `_modal_icon` / `_modal_title` / `_build_body`, calls `_build()` from its
## `setup()`, and ends its `open()` with `_show_modal()`. `_cancel()` is what the ✕, ESC and a
## backdrop click all funnel into, so dismissal stays in one place.
##
## A subclass also moves whatever it did after `_build()` in `setup()` into `_on_rebuilt()` —
## see the theme section below.
