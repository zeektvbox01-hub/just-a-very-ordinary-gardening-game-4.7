# Godoban - Advanced Task Manager for Godot

A Godot editor plugin that adds a full Godoban board as a main editor tab (next to 2D / 3D / Script) for
tracking the project's own tasks. It runs entirely in the editor (`@tool`) — there is no runtime
dependency, so nothing ships in your exported game.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Migrating from a version that predates multiple boards?** 1.1.0 stores one JSON file per board and
> no longer reads the old single-file layout, so older boards must be brought in by hand:
>
> - **Import your old board.** Godoban won't find it on its own — click the board chip in the toolbar
>   → **Import board** and point at your previous JSON (wherever you kept it, including a
>   `res://godoban_data.json` at the project root).
> - **Add a `"name"` to the JSON first** (recommended), otherwise the board imports as **"My Board"**.
>   It's a display name only — no task, epic, or date is touched — and you can rename it anytime with
>   the **pencil** on the board's row in the switcher.

## Requirements

- **Godot 4.7** (tested on 4.7.2)
- GDScript only — no C# or GDExtension needed.

## Installation

1. Copy the `addons/godoban/` folder into your project's `addons/` directory.
2. In Godot, open **Project → Project Settings → Plugins**.
3. Enable **Godoban**.
4. A **Godoban** tab appears next to 2D / 3D / Script. Open it and click **"＋ New Task"** to
   add your first card.

> Godoban never creates a board for you. On first run it shows a friendly **"No board yet"** empty
> state; use the board chip in the top bar to **New board** or **Import board**. The
> `res://godoban_boards/` folder (one JSON per board + a `boards.json` registry) is created the first
> time you make a board.

## Features

**Multiple boards**
- Keep any number of boards and switch between them from the board chip in the top bar.
- Each board is its own named JSON file under `res://godoban_boards/`.
- Removing every board leaves the plugin in a **"No board yet"** empty state (chip row only); it never
  auto-creates a default — use **New board** or **Import** to start again.
- One popup gives you the list of known boards (click to switch), **New board**, and
  **Import board** (pick any JSON on disk). Each row has a **pencil** to *rename* the
  board (renames the list entry + its JSON `name` field in place — the file itself is
  never renamed or moved) and an **"×"** to *remove from the list* — take a board out
  of the list without deleting its file.

**Board & tasks**
- **Five status columns** — Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Review, Done.
- **Drag & drop** — move cards between columns to change status, or place one exactly where you
  release it: the gap between two cards takes it between them (release between the 3rd and 4th and
  it becomes the 4th), below the last card it becomes last, and an empty column accepts it too.
  A thin line marks the target slot while you drag, drawn in the dragged card's priority color.
  Order sticks per column, across restarts.
- **No sort by default** — columns keep your arrangement until you choose a sort, and the manual
  order is kept underneath the other six, so switching back to **Manual** restores it untouched.
- **Priorities** — Low, Medium, High, Critical, color-coded on every card.
- **Tags** — free-form, with a searchable picker; filter by any tag. The **Tags** button
  in the toolbar opens **Manage Tags**, where tags are created, renamed in place, and deleted —
  renaming one updates every task that carried it, and a deletion says how many tasks it will
  touch before it happens.
- **Due dates** — set a date via a built-in calendar popup (Godot has no native date picker).
- **Descriptions** — multi-line notes on each task.
- **Click to edit** — any card opens in a modal popup over the board; each column has its own "＋".

**Epics**
- Lightweight, color-coded groups of related tasks (a name and a color).
- **Manage Epics** — the toolbar's **Epics** button opens a popup listing every epic with its color,
  title and task count. Titles are renamed in place, colors picked from the square beside them (or
  the pipette button pointing at it), and edits land as they're made; deleting one asks first when
  tasks are still assigned to it.
- **Per-epic view** — one compact board per epic, plus a "No Epic" board.
- Cards show a colored epic chip in the all-tasks view; deleting an epic reassigns instead of
  orphaning its tasks.

**Search & filters**
- Live, case-insensitive search across title, description, and tags.
- 7 sort modes — **Manual** (the default: no sort, so your dragged arrangement stands), plus
  created, latest edited, priority, due date, and alphabetical. Every other sort views your manual
  order through a lens rather than replacing it, so the arrangement is still there when you switch
  back.
- Filter by priority, epic, or tag; date bounds (overdue, due today, due this week, none).
- All filters combine; empty results show a friendly hint.

**View modes**
- **All Tasks** — one board with everything. **Per Epic** — one board per group.
- **Vertical / Horizontal** — stack cards down each column, or flow them across a row per status.
- Collapsible columns; state survives rebuilds.

**Overview dashboard**
- Summary cards (total / completed / in progress / overdue) with ring progress.
- By-status donut, priority bars, per-epic progress, and actionable lists
  (overdue, no-epic, upcoming).

**Editor-native theme**
- Matches your current editor theme — dark or light — so the board reads as native to the editor.
- The palette auto-syncs on every theme change.

## Data

Boards live under **`res://godoban_boards/`**:

- Each board is its own pretty-printed JSON file (recording the board's `name`), and a
  `boards.json` **registry** indexes them as id → name → path and marks which is current.
- **Imported** boards stay wherever you pick and are referenced by path — they're *not* moved into
  the folder.
- Saved on every change (debounced ~0.5s), plus on editor save/exit.
- Each board's `tasks` array is stored **in your manual column order**, so placing a card shows up
  as an ordinary diff — hand-edit the array and the board follows.
- Pretty-printed and git-diffable — safe to hand-edit or move between machines.
- **Removing a board from the list only unregisters it — Godoban never deletes the file.**
  To permanently delete a board, delete its JSON file yourself; the board then stops showing
  on the list. Deleting a board's JSON keeps the rest of the registry intact.

> A board imported from a pre-multi-board file takes its name from that file's `"name"` field,
> falling back to **"My Board"** when there isn't one.

## Notes

- The entire UI is built in GDScript at runtime — there are no scene files to edit. Visual changes
  are code changes.
- The bundled `Geist` font is licensed under the **SIL Open Font License**; see `fonts/OFL.txt`.
